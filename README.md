This repository contains the example presented (if there was time) in my
virtual machine presentation at SCCS2015.

Required software
=================

To get started, the following software is required:

VirtualBox version 4.3.10 (later versions should also work). Ubuntu users can
download this using "sudo apt-get install virtualbox" in the terminal. Other
people can download it from www.virtualbox.org.

Vagrant version 1.7.4 (later versions should also work). Ubuntu users can
download this using "sudo apt-get install vagrant" in the terminal. Other
people can download it from www.vagrantup.com.

Some other software was mentioned in the presentation, and is not needed to
create and work with virtual machines, but it is recommended to explore
advanced concepts. This is listed here to make it easier to find later:

Version control: www.github.com and www.bitbucket.org are good places to start.

Jenkins: www.jenkins-ci.org. This advanced software is for users that are more
confident in their software development capabilities (like Ed).

Cloud computing: www.azure.microsoft.com and www.digitalocean.com. Many other
cloud computing services exist from other companies. Student deals exist!

How to use
==========

Just command "vagrant up" with an Internet connection. Your virtual machine
should start automatically, and you should be able to interact with it in the
window.

If you've got the bug, explore VirtualBox and Vagrant more! More information
about both of these pieces of software can be found in the documentation on
their websites, though I recommend looking at Vagrant first in more detail.

Closing

If you have difficulty working with the software in this repository, or just
want to generally chat about virtual machines for research, I can be reached at
